### What is MAGE?

> *I return each time leaving fresh markers that I hope, in the full glare of my hopelessness, will have blossomed into fresh insight in the interim.*

First and foremost, MAGE is a rendering and game engine (or at the very least is supposed to be in the long run). Furthermore, MAGE is a journey. A journey of exploring and mastering C++ standards. A journey of best practices and proper designs aiming at consistency, clarity, efficiency and effectiveness. A journey of falling and changing directions. A journey of continuous learning, reflecting and philosophizing.

### Is MAGE still under (active) development?

MAGE v1 is still under active development.

### Does the MAGE logo refer to a *Black Mage* of Final Fantasy?

Apparently, the author of the full image intended to portray a *Black Mage* of the Final Fantasy game series. 
I, however, never played any Final Fantasy game and nor was I aware of the existence of these characters till some friend pointed this out at first glance. 
So for me, the logo just represents a mysterious, unknown mage ðŸ§™ and not some reference to a particular game or game series.
